# NIX OS Configuration

This configuration.nix is not meant to be used, but instead referenced for syntax when using NIX. 

If you do end up using it, make sure to change the apete user folder and cloning my dwm-ap repo into your `~/GitHub/dwm-ap` folder from the overlay portion. This will build dwm every time `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` is run.
